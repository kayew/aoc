# aoc-2019

## I didn't do very well last year. Here's to take 2.

### THE PLAN:
 * Actually take time to progress through each day.
 * Try to learn a new Language during AoC.
   * Lua (Within 15min of trying Go, I hated every minute of it.)
 * Not give up.
 * Document all code to the best of my ability so that I can understand happened here when I look back years later.
